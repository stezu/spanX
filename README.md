# SpanX

SpanX is a simple tool that will reduce the physical size of your website. With the recent release of the incredibly thin iPad Air, many websites fail to fit inside the device. If you've created a site with a z-index over 100, you're in tough shape. This plugin will ensure that all your z-indexes are defined at a proper scale so your site could fit in an iPad Air.
